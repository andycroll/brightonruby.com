You can either try to guess your way out of a bug and potentially end up spending a large amount of time getting carried away and going off in unproductive directions.

_Or_ you can make use of the 9 golden rules of debugging to track down pesky bugs systematically, in no time at all.

This is a talk inspired by a book by David J. Agans book, a forgotten classic, "Debugging: the 9 indispensable rules for finding even the most elusive software and hardware problems".
