Sidekiq, the popular Ruby job framework, moves billions of USD per year on behalf of 200,000 small businesses at Gusto, an American FinTech company. But every relationship is not without its trials. How did this library go from down on its luck to “bae” within one company?

In this talk, learn how to level-up your own usage of Sidekiq, avoid some of its pitfalls, set your databases on fire, teach your teammates Sidekiq’s best practices, and how to scale Sidekiq, whether you’re moving a few bucks or a few billion.
