`nil`

Well that's awkward. What do we do now? We can't just carry on and pretend we have a value -- that never ends well. Do we swap it out for a default value? Do we write a special program just for handling nil? Do we crash? Or do we rewrite everything from scratch in Haskell?

What can we learn about Ruby by thinking about a world where nil can never exist? And what can we learn about Haskell by thinking about a world where it can? And what can we learn about ourselves by recognising that both of these worlds are the world we live in.
