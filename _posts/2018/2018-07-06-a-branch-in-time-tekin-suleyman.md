description: 'A considered history of your code can be powerful. Learn tools and techniques that can mean the difference between hours of frustration and a quick path to clarity.'

In one timeline a quick path to clarity. In the other a long and painful journey trying to understand the obscure intent of a line of code. The only difference between these two realities? The revision history.

This is a talk about writing maintainable code. But rather than the code itself, we'll see the impact a codebase's history can have on its maintainability. We'll explore the differences between a useful history and an unhelpful one, and you'll learn about the practices, tools and techniques that can make the difference.
