As novices we slowly and laboriously sift through a chaotic flood of
minutia. To experts the significant details are obvious. Irrelevant
details fade to the background. The novice receives a jumble of
meaningless impressions; the expert sees patterns and meaning.

to "How could you not?". And they probably can't tell you how they got
there.

This talk examines the topic of perceptual learning through the lens
of theory and practice—research and anecdotes—and speculates how it
can be deployed strategically to train new experts.
