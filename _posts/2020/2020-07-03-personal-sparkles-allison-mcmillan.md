A _new_ talk, based on an old one - planning for personal sparkles: A COVID-19 plan.

Before we talked about maximizing your work day but in today’s world, Allison has re-done the talk to focus on how to take advantage of the bits and bursts of focus you may get in a day.

There’s a lot going on in the world and hopefully this talk helps.
