After a stressful couple of days at work, Deirdre Bug is looking forward to a quiet evening in. But her plans are thwarted when the phone rings. “I know I’m the last person you want to hear from…but...I need your help!”

Follow Deirdre as she embarks on an adventure that features a looming Demo Day with serious prize money, a trip inside the walls of one of the Ruby community’s most revered institutions, and some broken code that appears to be much more simple than meets the eye.
