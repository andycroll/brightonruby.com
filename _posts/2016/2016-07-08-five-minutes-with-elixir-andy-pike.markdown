We love Ruby but it has it’s problems. Concurrency, performance, fault tolerant being some of them. Elixir is a functional language built on the Erlang VM which is now around 30 years old. It was built to solve these problems for telephone networks.

When was the last time your phone network went down for “Scheduled Maintenance” or went down due to issues? I certainly can’t remember a single occasion. With Elixir we now have an expressive language like we have with Ruby but now with the power of the Erlang VM. This talk will show you a super brief look at Elixir with the hope that you might give it a try.

Contains mad rhymes.
