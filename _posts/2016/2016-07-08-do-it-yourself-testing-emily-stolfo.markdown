The drivers team at MongoDB focused over the last year on conforming to common APIs and algorithms but we needed a shared way to test our 9 drivers. We therefore ended up building our own testing DSL, REST service, and individual test frameworks to validate our consistency.

Using these common tests and the Ruby driver’s test suite as examples, this talk shows you how they designed and built a custom testing framework and perhaps tempt you to do the same.
