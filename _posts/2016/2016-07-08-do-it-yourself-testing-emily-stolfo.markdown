The drivers team at MongoDB focused over the last year on conforming to common APIs and algorithms but we needed a shared way to test our 9 drivers. We therefore ended up building our own testing DSL, REST service, and individual test frameworks to validate our consistency.

Using these common tests and the Ruby driverâ€™s test suite as examples, this talk shows you how they designed and built a custom testing framework and perhaps tempt you to do the same.
