Objects are abstractions and we should be suspicious of them. Not only are abstractions hard, but bad abstractions are harmful to programming. So why use objects? Why not just stick to the simpler and more natural world of procedural programming?

In this talk we take some real world ruby code written in a procedural style and refactor it to an Object Oriented style. Along the way weâ€™ll see how this changes the we think about programming, and how this gives us better tools for tackling the inevitable complexity that will creep into your project.
