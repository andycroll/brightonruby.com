“The limits of my language mean the limits of my world”, said Wittgenstein.

In human-to-human languages the same core ideas get shaped differently depending on the language in which they are spoken. What if every computational language engenders a set (or a subset) of culture and values, and as a consequence attracts and shapes a corresponding community?

What are the values that entered into the language by way of its core committers and what are the values we identify with as a community. How can making these values explicit help us foster a better community?
