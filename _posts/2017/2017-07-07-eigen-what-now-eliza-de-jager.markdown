Eigenclasses are an important construct in Ruby and, although obscured from the everyday developer, are core to many meta-programming principles and techniques.

We delve into what an eigenclass is, how to access it, and how to make use of this knowledge in order to improve our meta-programming techniques. Method lookup, singleton methods, `class_eval` and `instance_eval`, and `include` and `extend` will all be explained in the context of eigenclasses.
