Being an open source contributor requires many resources we often take for granted: technical knowledge, confidence in that knowledge, access to technical tools, and a socioeconomic status that allows us to code without financial compensation. These resources are inaccessible to many, if not most.

Shifting the face of our community to better represent our increasingly global user base requires us to examine what groups are least likely to have access to these resources and how different organizations and initiatives are working to remove these barriers and create entry points for groups of people who face the biggest obstacles in their journey to becoming creators in our community.
