Sadly, Matthew died a few weeks after giving this presentation. Matthew was well loved in the Ruby community, both in the UK and Hong Kong. He will be missed.

**Content warning** Matthew worked with the Department of Justice on projects related to moving prisoners, this project was discussed during the talk.

A year ago I was looking for a job, and ended up taking a job as a “Technical Architect”.

But what exactly is a Technical Architect?

Weren’t Software Architects a thing in the 90s, cast away when we learnt about Agile?

In this talk I’m going to tell the story of my year in government as a Technical Architect, and hopefully convince you that there is a place for just enough architecture in modern software development.

And maybe it’s a role you’d be interested in
