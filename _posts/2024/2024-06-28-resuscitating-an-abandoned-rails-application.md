author_bio_markdown: "I’m Matt Rayner, a talented and dedicated full stack, polyglot engineer. I’m looking for a challenging environment to test and improve my skills. I love learning new things and am an early adopter of bleeding edge technologies. Outside of work I’m involved in volunteering and a number of side projects. Everything from training students in multimedia and design skills, through to Give Cat - a bookmarklet that replaces all the images on a website with pictures of cats (what more could you want, right?)."
