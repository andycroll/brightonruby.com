Lots of people in Ruby community choose RSpec as the default without really considering its drawbacks. I feel like not much is being done to popularise other test frameworks. Cleo is a fairly successful project that has used Minitest since its inception in 2016, and I would love to share this success story from a perspective of someone who hadn’t professionally worked with Minitest before joining Cleo.
