In this talk, we'll walk through designing a feature like Notifications and how naming, DSLs, metaprogramming, and a bunch of other small decisions can make code feel delightful to use. Plus, we'll take a look at some of the decisions along the way that didn't turn out so well, analyze why they didn't work, and how we can improve them.
