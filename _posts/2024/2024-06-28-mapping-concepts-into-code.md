Implementing a feature like "notifications" in an app sounds simple, right? As you dig in to problems like this, you'll realize the complexity that lies below the surface.

In this talk, we'll walk through designing a feature like Notifications and how naming, DSLs, metaprogramming, and a bunch of other small decisions can make code feel delightful to use. Plus, we'll take a look at some of the decisions along the way that didn't turn out so well, analyze why they didn't work, and how we can improve them.
