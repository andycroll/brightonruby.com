I think the food quality of Brighton deserves it's own page...

## Food

We have all the decent chains: Bills (before it was a chain), Pho, Pizza Express, Wagamamas, Wahaca, Rudy’s, Smashburger, Honest Burger, Nandos et al. All within reach of the venue.

And we obviously have our fair share of Subway, Starbucks, Costa, McDonald's and KFC. But... you _can_ eat really well in Brighton.

## Drink

Sussex has a strong brewing (proper ales, not lager) tradition. Now I'm in my ~~thirties~~ forties that's what I'm allowed to drink.

[Harveys](http://www.harveys.org.uk) is the local brewery (based in next-town-along Lewes) and other smaller local brewers include [Long Man](http://www.longmanbrewery.com) and [Dark Star](http://darkstarbrewing.co.uk).

We have some cash put away at the venue for after-conference drinks, but if you want to move on there are tons of pubs within 10 minutes walk. Pick one, sit in it, you'll probably like it.
