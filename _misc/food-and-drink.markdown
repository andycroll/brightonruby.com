I think the food quality of Brighton deserves it's own page...

## Food

We have all the decent chains: Bills (before it was a chain), Pho, Pizza Express, Wagamamas, Wahaca, et al. All within reach of the venue.

And we obviously have our fair share of Subway, Starbucks, Costa, McDonald's and KFC. But... you _can_ eat really well in Brighton.

## Drink

Sussex has a strong brewing (proper ales, not lager) tradition. Now I'm in my ~~thirties~~ forties that's what I'm allowed to drink.

[Harveys](http://www.harveys.org.uk) is the local brewery (based in next-town-along Lewes) and other smaller local brewers include [Long Man](http://www.longmanbrewery.com) and [Dark Star](http://darkstarbrewing.co.uk).

We have some cash put away at the venue for after-conference drinks, but if you want to move on there are tons of pubs within 10 minutes walk. Pick one, sit in it, you'll probably like it.
