Now admittedly this is only the ninth edition, because we all got told to stay in our houses for a bit. But after the smaller event in 2022, this is the return to your regularly scheduled programming.

It was big, bigger than ever before. Which is why the videos are a little more professionally produced and there is actual, professional, photographic record.

My thanks to [Big Egg Films](https://bigeggfilms.com) for the excellent video and editing work and [Clive Andrews](https://cliveandrews.com) for the photography throughout.
