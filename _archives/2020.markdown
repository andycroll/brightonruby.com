A slightly odd, quasi-conference for strange times.

There was no in-person Brighton Ruby, because we were all shut in our houses. Delivered throughout June/July/August 2020.

With the help of the fine people at [Consonance](https://www.consonance.app) we printed a beautifully typeset physical copy of _why’s [poignant guide to ruby](https://poignant.guide).

After the videos I had informative chats with the speakers on the [Made of People Podcast](https://madeofpeoplepodcast.com).
